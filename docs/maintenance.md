# Maintenance Guide

## Updating the Bot
To pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Restart the bot process after updating.

## Backing Up Data
- **JSON Data**: Regularly back up the `data/` folder.

## Monitoring
- Check the console logs for errors.
- Ensure the bot process is kept alive using a process manager like PM2 or systemd (if not on Replit).
- On Replit, use the "Workflows" or "Logs" tab to monitor status.

## Troubleshooting
- **Rate Limits**: If the bot is being rate-limited by Discord, check if you are performing too many actions (like webhook creations) in a short period.
- **Dependency Issues**: Run `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` to ensure all libraries are up to date.
